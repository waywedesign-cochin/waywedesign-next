                  <p className="service-details__text ">
                    Video production involves the entire process of creating a
                    video, from pre-production to post-production. </p>  <p className="service-details__text ">
                    In pre-production, the digital marketing company works with
                    the client to determine the goals of the video, identify the
                    target audience, and develop a creative concept. This may
                    involve creating a storyboard or script, casting actors or
                    selecting presenters, scouting locations, and planning the
                    shoot. </p>  <p className="service-details__text ">
                    During production, the digital marketing company is
                    responsible for capturing the footage and audio needed to
                    create the final video. This may involve using
                    professional-grade cameras, lighting, and sound equipment,
                    as well as directing actors or presenters and coordinating
                    with any additional crew members. </p>  <p className="service-details__text ">
                    Post-production involves editing the raw footage, adding
                    special effects, music, and other elements, and creating a
                    final product that meets the client's goals and
                    expectations. This may include color correction, sound
                    mixing, and the addition of graphics or animation. </p>  <p className="service-details__text ">
                    The digital marketing company may also provide additional
                    services, such as distribution and promotion of the final
                    video. This may involve publishing the video on social media
                    platforms, creating a landing page on the client's website,
                    or promoting the video through email marketing or other
                    digital advertising channels. </p>  <p className="service-details__text ">
                    Overall, video production is a complex process that requires
                    a high level of expertise and experience. A digital
                    marketing company that specializes in video production can
                    provide the resources and expertise needed to create
                    high-quality, engaging videos that effectively communicate
                    the client's message and achieve their marketing goals.
